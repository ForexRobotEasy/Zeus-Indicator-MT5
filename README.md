## Description

The Zeus Indicator is a custom indicator for MetaTrader 5 platform. It calculates signals based on market analysis and provides buy or sell signals for trading decisions. The indicator takes into account two input parameters - Parameter1 and Parameter2, which can be adjusted according to user preferences.

The indicator initializes and sets up the indicator buffer, style, label, and short name. It then iterates over the price data received from the platform and calculates the signal for each bar. The signal is determined based on the open and close prices of the bar, as well as the input parameters. If the close price is higher than the open price and meets the specified conditions, a bullish signal is generated. If the close price is lower than the open price and meets the specified conditions, a bearish signal is generated. Otherwise, no signal is generated.

The indicator also includes two custom functions. The first function, `MakeInformedDecision()`, analyzes the signal and executes the corresponding trade. If the signal is positive, a buy trade is executed. If the signal is negative, a sell trade is executed. If there is no signal, no trade is executed. The second function, `RealTimeAlert()`, checks for trading opportunities based on the signal. If a trading opportunity is detected, an alert notification is sent. If there are no trading opportunities, a notification is sent indicating the same.
